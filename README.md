# IRRemote

Android + Arduino IOT suite to send IR Signal.

## Usage

### Arduino Server

You need a Arduino board with WIFI functionality. You also need a IR LED plugged on pin 3.

Follow [https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) to install the IR library. 

After installed the library, you should be able to compile the program.
